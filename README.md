# Sample Hardhat Project

yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
yarn hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network hardhat
# to run on a perticular network here hardhat!

yarn hardhat verify --network mainnet DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS "Constructor argument 1"
# to deploy a verified contract from the terminal

```
